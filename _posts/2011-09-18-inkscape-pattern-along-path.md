Ah HA! One more of these moments.

As I think it happened many times on that one, I will take 5 minutes and write
myself a (google-indexed) note:

For pattern-along-path to work, both objects have to be paths (that's easy), but
more importantly, the pattern one, needs to be a closed path, i.e. a single
line won't work (it's obvious why: Inkscape can not stretch a single line...).

*SO* obvious when you know it.
