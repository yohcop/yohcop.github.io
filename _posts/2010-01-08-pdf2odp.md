Initially written to have a pdf presentation written with latex, imported into Google docs. Google docs have the option of reading a pdf, but at the time of this witting, there were not presentation mode for pdf documents, or any ways of importing pdf into a presentation.

### Usage ###

{% highlight bash %}
python build.py input.pdf /tmp/out
{% endhighlight %}

The file /tmp/out.odp will be written.

To convert it to ppt (Microsoft powerpoint), open the odp with open office, and use the save as function.

### Requirements ###

python, convert (imagemagick), zip, open office (optional).

### Download ###

Download the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/files/pdf2odp.zip">pdf2odp</a> fileÂ after reading and accepting the license and no warranty clause below.

### How it works ###

It creates a list of images using convert from the pdf: one image per page, then using a odp template file (don't try to open it, it is a not a valid odp file by itself), it generates a valid open document presentation. You can convert it to ppt with open office for instance.
