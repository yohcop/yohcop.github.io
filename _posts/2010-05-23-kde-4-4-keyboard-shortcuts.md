It just took me about 20 minutes to figure out where the h\*#@!! are the settings for keyboard shortcuts under KDE 4.4...

My hard drive was failing, so I bought another one (I have plenty of backups :) yay!), install it, install Kubuntu 10.04, run a script I have that configure some stuff for me (vim, bashrc, and other config files).

Then I have to configure some keyboard shortcuts for my favorite applications. Actually, I hate doing that too, and I would love to setup a script that would just copy some files from my backup, and I would be up and running in 5 minutes. That would work great with Fluxbox for example, and it's very simple config files. But KDE ? Now way ! There are so many config files (74 under .kde/share/config after a fresh install), I even doubt that they are all used.

So anyway, it took me a good 20 minutes, so for the next time I have to do that... To setup keyboard shortcuts for an application, *right click on the launcher -> menu editor*. From here it's easy. But once setup, it will not work right away apparently. You have to go in *System settings -> Input Actions*, and make sure thatÂ *KMenuEdit* is checked.

That's so weird.....
