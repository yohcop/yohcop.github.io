So the other day, I downloaded my bank account information. It was offered to me as QFX of Microsoft Money. I needed CSV.

Quick search for Qfx2Csv... nothing in the first results that is free, and work under linux. I didn't search much, since I realized I would spend more time searching than writing a quick piece of code for doing the same thing. Quick and dirty coding :).

So just in case I need it again, or if it is useful to someone else.

Usage: python qfx2csv.py input.qfx output.csv
